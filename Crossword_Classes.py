# Classes for Project 7 CSE 231
#
# The following code contains two Classes: Clue & Crossword. The clue class
# represents a single clue in the crossword puzzle while the Crossword class
# represents the entire crossword puzzle. Crossword contains methods such as
# changing the guess, revealing the answer, finding the fist instance of a wrong
# letter, and checking if the puzzle is solved.
